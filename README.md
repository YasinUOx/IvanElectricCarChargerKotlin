Ivan Electric Car Chargers
====

This is an example codebase for a "legacy code" workshop.

It's a simple program for finding out the best time to plug in your car to charge, using data from [National Grid ESO](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/).
It is not meant to be a useful program - it is just something for a lab in retro-fitting tests to an existing codebase.

If you want to try out this program, execute: `./gradlew run`

Run the usual build and tests:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

"Example" tests
----

Some "tests" have been included - they are not tests for this program, but rather demonstrate some useful bits of Java or test infrastructure which might be useful in this lab, to give you some hints and save you time in looking these things up.
